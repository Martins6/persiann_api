# persiann_api

The __persiann_api__ python package was built in order to make data more readily available for data scientist, analyst, etc, that wish to work with weather data through the [PERSIANN](https://chrsdata.eng.uci.edu/) database.

This database is made from the "system developed by the Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) uses neural network function classification/approximation procedures to compute an estimate of rainfall rate at each 0.25° x 0.25° pixel of the infrared brightness temperature image provided by geostationary satellites."
